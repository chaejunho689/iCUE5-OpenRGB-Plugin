# Description
This plugin allows creating custom device layouts using json files and custom images as well as generating some generic LED layouts if there is no defined device. Corsair has not released an official SDK for adding custom devices. The reverse engineering is contained in `CUESDKDevice.h`.

# Files of Importance
* `version.dll` - This is a wrapper dll to disable iCUE's signature check on plugins loaded from the Plugins folder. Normally iCUE will run WinVerifyTrust on all plugins it is attempting to load. I haven't determined whether it needs to be signed by Corsair specifically, this wrapper when placed in the Corsair iCUE program directory will disable this check entirely.
* `CUEORGBPlugin.dll` - This implements the OpenRGB Client interface and utilizes/merges json files to create devices
* `settings.json` - This file specifies the default LED/Zone layout display of some devices in the event no specific device is found within `devices.json`
* `devices.json` - This file maps devices by name given within OpenRGB and allows overriding the Default layout
 
# Release Installation
* Install at least 1 plugin in iCUE for the iCUE plugin host to be enabled.
* Close iCUE completely by right-clicking in the task bar and pressing `Quit`
* Copy `plugins\OpenRGB` folder to `C:\Program Files\Corsair\CORSAIR iCUE 5 Software\plugins`
* Copy built `version.dll` to `C:\Program Files\Corsair\CORSAIR iCUE 5 Software`
* Configure devices.json and settings.json as per the [config guide](#how-to-configure-the-two-json-files-and-add-images) 

# OpenRGB Installation
* Download [OpenRGB]((https://openrgb.org/releases.html))
* Place the folder anywhere (preferably in Program Files)
* Run OpenRGB
* Open the supported devices settings in OpenRGB and disable all Corsair devices to prevent conflicts (e.g. Commander Pro fan speeds may no longer show up after device scan).
* You might want to enable the "minimize on close" option in OpenRGB to prevent it from closing when the main window is closed.
* Navigate to `SDK Server` tab
* Press `Start Server`
* Run iCUE

OpenRGB should look like the following when iCUE connects:

# OpenRGB as a Startup process (Windows)
You might want to start OpenRGB when you start windows as iCUE is also a Startup process. Allowing OpenRGB to be started alongside will allow you to resume effects controlled by iCUE when both programs start
* Go to the settings in OpenRGB
* Go to the general settings, enable start on login, start minimized and start server.

# How to configure the two .json files and add images
* The JSON configuration files for this plugin were created by the previous developer, not me. Based on my understanding, I'll try to explain how they should be set up.
* To add images, place them in the images folder. If you wanted to add a motherboard for example, you'd have to place the image in /images/mothermoard/BRAND_NAME/device_view.png or promo.png or thumbnail.png.
* Device view is the big picture that appears when you click on a device. Promo is the picture that appears on the start page of iCUE. Lastly, thumbnail is the picture which appears in the top row while you have a device selected.
* Devices.json should be configured like so:
* ![JSON](/screenshots/devices_json2.png)
* Name: The name as it is displayed in OpenRGB
* Thumbnail and Image: The path to your images
* InheritDefault: false
* Zones: The name of the zones you want to control, just like they are named in OpenRGB
* Views/Image: The path to your device view image. I suggest copying the default one.
* Views/PolyGenerator: Specify your zone once again. Rect contains coordinates to where the rectangle in the iCUE device view should be placed. See the screenshot below for an explanation.
* ![Rect](/screenshots/rectangle.png)
* To configure multiple zones, configure them like in the screenshot below.
* ![Multiple Zones](/screenshots/multiple_zones.png)
* The only option that you should pay attention to inside of the settings.json file is the "IgnoreMouse" option. If it is set to true, the 2nd connected device will already be the "headset" or "mousemat" type. This will cause the effects to only be changeable via "lighting link" or murals. If you set it to false, the 2nd connected device will be able to be controlled via individual effects and with the "lighting sync". It will however not appear in murals.
* See the table below for some more info on IgnoreMouse.
* ![JSON](/screenshots/settings2_json.png)

| 1st Connected Device | 2nd Connected Device | 2nd Connected Device | 3rd and More |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| IgnoreMouse: N/A | IgnoreMouse: False | IgnoreMouse: True | IgnoreMouse: N/A |
| Individual Control: Yes | Individual Control: Yes | Individual Control: No | Individual Control: No |
| Lighting Link: Yes | Lighting Link: Yes | Lighting Link: Yes | Lighting Link: Yes |
| Murals: Yes | Murals: No | Murals: Yes | Murals: Yes |

# Compiling
Should be no major dependencies, built with Visual Studio Community 2022.

# Current bugs
* Colors and effects can only be individually set on 2 devices. Every device over 2 devices will follow the lighting link effect(s). I assume that it is necessary to alter the CreadeDeviceInfo method to create devices with the other device types.
* It is currently not possible to control which device will be one of the 2 which can be individually controlled. I'm working on making a config file where the user can specify which 2 devices should be the individually controlable ones. This workaround will have to exist until I figure out how to set more than 2 device types that work with all functions.
